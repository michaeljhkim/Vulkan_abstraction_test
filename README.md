# Vulkan_abstraction_test
This repo is for personal vulkan tests. Original guide: https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction

I am familiar with opengl, but not vulkan, so I will take the existing hello triangle from the vulkan tutorial, and try to abstract the code. The idea is to split up the code into more manageable pieces, and understand how they fit together. The eventual plan is to take what I need from this in order to convert the opengl game engine into vulkan.
